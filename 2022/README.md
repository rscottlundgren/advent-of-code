# 2022 - The Plot So Far...

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

|                              Day                              |               Concepts               | Summary  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| [Day 01 - Calorie Counting](./day01) | Arrays, Conditionals, "For"/"While" Loops, Integers | We're off to hunt some star fruit for the oh-so-magical reindeer! That said, we need to make sure we have enough calories to make the journey first. Once we've disembarked from the boats that took us to the island, we take stock of what we have for food to get us through the trip. <ol><li>To start, we'll tally the number of calories each Elf is carrying so we know who has the most.</li><li>Afterwards, we'll tally the number of calories held by the three Elves with the most calories.</li></ol> |
| [Day 02 - Rock Paper Scissors](./day02) | Strings, Switch Statements, Conditionals | With our calories counted, it's time to decide where everyone sleeps on the beach as it's been a long journey. As everyone wants to sleep near the snacks, we play rounds of "Rock Paper Scissors" to determine who's closest. <ol><li>To start, we'll use a "strategy guide" provided by a friendly Elf to rig the game in our favor so we sleep closest to the food.</li><li>Afterwards, with a little Elven translation assistance, we'll use the "strategy guide" (correctly this time) to rig the game in our favor, fo' realz.</li><ol> |
| [Day 03 - Rucksack Reorganization](./day03) | Sets (HashSet), Arrays, Conditionals, "While" Loops | Time to pack up for our journey for the star fruit after a relaxing night on the beach. However, the Elf in charge of packing made a couple of mistakes. All rucksacks have two compartments (each compartment can only contain certain types of items) and we also need to sticker Elf team badges for this year! <ol><li>To start, we'll have to determine which item type & priority combination appears in both compartments of each rucksack, providing the sum-total of those item priorities that need to be reshuffled.</li><li>Afterwards, we need to locate the "Elf Team Badges" & their priority that are spread across three rucksacks, providing the sum-total of those badge priorities.</li><ol> |
| [Day 04 - Camp Cleanup](./day04) | Conditionals, Switch Statements | Time to clean up the camp! One of the Elves (the most organized of the brood, I imagine) has divided the camp into many sections and has randomly assigned a range of sections to all of the Elves. There's just one problem - some of those sections overlap which means that some sections will be cleaned multiple times and we've been asked to help assess how much overlap is occurring. <ol><li>To start, we'll have to determine how many pairs of ranged sections are completely overlapping their complementary pair.</li><li>Afterwards, we need to determine how many pairs of ranged sections are partially overlapping their complementary pair.</li></ol>

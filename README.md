# About This Repo
Greets - welcome to my repo of solutions to "Advent of Code". I started doing this right after my first semester at Harvard Extension School finished as I prepped to apply for my Masters in Software Engineering. Honestly, I figure this is a great way for me to stay sharp during & between semesters. If you're a dev and you're checking out my code I'd really appreciate your thoughts on these (or any other) code related topics:

- [ ] Does the code "smell" to you?
- [ ] Is there a better way I could be approaching a specific problem?
- [ ] Am I missing some generic "style" that you typically see in production code?
- [ ] See something you think is clever?

I'm sure more will come for this particular "README" but I have a load of wash that just beeped - I'll fill more out later...

# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) was developed by a lovely gent named Eric Wastl (for the nerds in the class, you may know him because he developed [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) and other really cool stuff). If you're interested in seeing some of his other stuff you can check it out on his [projects page](http://was.tl/projects/). If you want to read more about Advent of Code and what it's all about you can check out [this page](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).
